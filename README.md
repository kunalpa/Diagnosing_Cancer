## Abstract

Classification is one of the fields at the forefront of machine learning research. Our daily lives already use advanced data processing models, whether for identifying spam emails or predicting defaulted loans. This project utilizes a dataset of patient breast imaging classification containing both qualitative and quantitative aspects. In this paper, we construct and compare the accuracy, precision, and recall to classify whether a patient has a malignant or benign breast mass across various tree-based models.
